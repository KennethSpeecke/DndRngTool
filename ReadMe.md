# RNG D&D Tool

## What is this?
RNG D&D Tool helps users keep track of their D&D sessions. Anyone who plays d&d knows that a lot of documents, notes, photos, cards, etc... have to be kept up to date. In practice, it often happens that these documents are damaged and/or lost.
But especially the Game Master can speak about this.
RNG fixes all these concerns by incorporating all these processes into an application.
Once everyone is logged in, has entered the game session on the app and is ready at the game table then the adventure begins.
