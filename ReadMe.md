# RNG D&D Tool

## What is this?
RNG D&D Tool helps users keep track of their D&D sessions. Anyone who plays d&d knows that a lot of documents, notes, photos, cards, etc... have to be kept up to date. In practice, it often happens that these documents are damaged and/or lost.
But especially the Game Master can speak about this.
RNG obsolete all these concerns by incorporating all these processes into an application.
Once everyone is logged in, the room has entered the app and is ready at the game table, the adventure can begin.
